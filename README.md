**AI-Powered Travel Planning That Actually Gets You**

Wanderly transforms how people plan trips by combining conversational AI with intelligent itinerary generation. Instead of spending hours researching destinations, comparing options, and building itineraries, users simply describe their dream trip in natural language and get a personalized, detailed travel plan.

## The Problem

Travel planning is broken. The current process involves juggling multiple apps, websites, and tools:
- **Research phase**: Hours spent on Google, TripAdvisor, and travel blogs
- **Booking phase**: Switching between booking platforms, comparing prices
- **Planning phase**: Manually creating day-by-day itineraries
- **Coordination phase**: Managing group preferences and logistics

The result? Most people either over-plan (stressing over every detail) or under-plan (missing amazing experiences), leading to suboptimal travel experiences.

## Our Solution

Wanderly is the first AI travel assistant that handles the entire planning process through natural conversation. Users describe their trip in plain English, and our AI:

1. **Extracts structured preferences** from natural language using Anthropic's Claude
2. **Generates personalized recommendations** for restaurants, activities, and accommodations
3. **Creates detailed itineraries** optimized for their travel style and constraints
4. **Provides interactive refinement** through swipe-based preference learning

## Key Features

### 🤖 **Intelligent Trip Intake**
- Natural language processing extracts destinations, dates, budget, party size, and travel style
- Smart follow-up questions ensure we capture all preferences
- Context-aware conversation that remembers previous responses

### 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations**
- AI-generated restaurant and activity suggestions based on user preferences
- Swipe-based interface for quick preference learning
- Real-time itinerary optimization based on user feedback

### 📱 **Seamless User Experience**
- Beautiful, intuitive mobile-first design
- No sign-up required for initial planning
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)

### ⚡ **Technical Excellence**
- Serverless architecture with Vercel deployment
- Real-time API integration with Anthropic Claude
- Optimized performance with intelligent caching

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile development
- **Backend**: Node.js serverless functions on Vercel
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude for natural language processing and content generation
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient client-side state management
- **Maps**: React Native Maps for location-based features
- **Styling**: Custom design system with modern UI components

## Market Opportunity

The global travel planning market is valued at $1.2 trillion, with digital travel services growing at 15% annually. Current solutions are fragmented and time-consuming:

- **Booking.com**: Focuses on accommodation, not planning
- **TripAdvisor**: Information overload without personalization
- **Google Travel**: Basic itinerary suggestions, no AI conversation
- **Travel agents**: Expensive and slow for simple trips

Wanderly addresses the gap between DIY planning tools and expensive travel agents, targeting the growing segment of tech-savvy travelers who want personalized, efficient trip planning.

## Business Model

- **Freemium**: Free basic trip planning with limited recommendations
- **Premium**: $9.99/month for unlimited trips, advanced AI features, and booking integration
- **Enterprise**: White-label solutions for travel agencies and corporate travel

## How It Works

1. **Natural Conversation**: Users describe their trip in plain English - "I want to go to Tokyo for 5 days with my partner, we love food and want to stay under $200/day"

2. **AI Understanding**: Our system extracts key details (destinations, dates, budget, preferences) and asks smart follow-up questions to fill any gaps

3. **Personalized Recommendations**: We generate curated lists of restaurants, activities, and experiences tailored to their specific interests and constraints

4. **Interactive Refinement**: Users swipe through recommendations to teach our AI their preferences, which immediately improves the suggestions

5. **Complete Itinerary**: The final result is a detailed, day-by-day travel plan optimized for their style, budget, and interests
